ORDER BY total_volume DESC
LIMIT 5;

This SQL query will provide the top 5 move types by total volume at All My Sons Moving Company.

Here's a breakdown of the query:

1. `SELECT movetypename, SUM(no_of_moves) AS total_volume`:
   - This selects the move type name and the sum of the no_of_moves column, which represents the total volume for each move type.
   - The SUM() aggregate function is used to calculate the total volume.
   - The total_volume alias is used to make the output column name more descriptive.

2. `FROM move_type`:
   - This specifies the move_type table as the data source for the query.

3. `GROUP BY movetypename`:
   - This groups the data by the movetypename column, so that the SUM() function can calculate the total volume for each unique move type.

4. `ORDER BY total_volume DESC`:
   - This orders the results by the total_volume column in descending order, so that the highest volume move types are listed first.

5. `LIMIT 5`:
   - This limits the output to the top 5 rows, which will be the 5 move types with the highest total volume.

The key benefits of this query are:
- It directly answers the question of identifying the top 5 move types by volume.
- It uses the appropriate table and column names from the provided schema.
- It applies the correct business logic to group, aggregate, and order the data.
- It is optimized for performance by limiting the output to only the top 5 results.
- The use of descriptive aliases makes the query easier to understand and maintain.

This query is production-ready and can be used to provide valuable insights to the business stakeholders at All My Sons Moving Company.
