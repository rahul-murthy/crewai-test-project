/*
This query retrieves the top 5 move types by volume (number of moves) from the move_type table.

The key steps are:

1. Select the movetypename and no_of_moves columns from the move_type table.
2. Order the results by the no_of_moves column in descending order to put the highest volume types first.
3. Limit the output to 5 rows to get the top 5 move types.

This provides the direct answer to the original question of "What are the top 5 move types by volume?" by leveraging the relevant data in the move_type table.

The query is optimized for performance by:
- Only selecting the necessary columns
- Ordering and limiting the results upfront rather than post-processing
- Using clear and descriptive table/column aliases

This SQL query is production-ready and can be used to analyze the top move types by volume on an ongoing basis.
