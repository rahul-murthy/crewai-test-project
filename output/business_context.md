Term definitions:
- Volume: The number of completed moves for a given move type or service category. This is a key metric for understanding demand and resource allocation.

Business rules:
- Moves should be filtered to exclude the "Unknown" category, as these represent data quality issues that should be addressed separately.
- Moves should be grouped and aggregated by the defined move type categories (e.g. Local, Long Distance, etc.) to identify the top volume drivers.
