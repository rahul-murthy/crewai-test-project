The primary revenue streams for All My Sons Moving Company are:

1. Local Moves (17.8% of volume): Local moves within a metropolitan area, typically with lower pricing.
2. Long Distance Moves (11.3% of volume): Longer-distance moves between cities, with premium pricing.
3. Short Haul Moves (11.0% of volume): Shorter-distance moves outside the local metro area.
4. Labor Only Services (7.5% of volume): Providing labor-only moving services without the company's equipment.

The company also tracks move size categories, with the top categories being Apartment 1 Bedroom (10.8%), House 3 Bedroom (10.4%), and Few Items (9.6%). The "Unknown" category accounts for 15.5% of moves, indicating a potential data quality improvement opportunity.

Seasonal patterns are critical for the business, as move volume varies significantly by month. The company uses this data for capacity planning, pricing adjustments, and resource allocation.

Pricing strategies differentiate between move types (local vs. long distance) and move sizes (apartment vs. house). Factors like crew allocation, fuel costs, and market conditions also influence pricing. Optimizing pricing is a key lever for revenue growth.

To analyze revenue stream trends over time, the company can use SQL queries to aggregate revenue by move type and group by time period (e.g., month, quarter, year). This will reveal significant shifts in the revenue mix, seasonality, and highlight potential opportunities for optimization.

Overall, understanding the business context around revenue streams, move categories, seasonal patterns, and pricing strategies is essential for accurately interpreting the data and making informed recommendations to improve the company's financial performance.
